DirectX-Fun
===========

Messing around with DirectX various graphical features/abilities.

I am mostly focusing on general work in the "Engine" project, and then showcasing that work with the "Game" project.

This is very much a work in progress, and while I already have much more than what is shown here (from my work on other projects), I am reworking it all to make it better and more presentable.

To Add:
 • Camera with CameraManager classes
 • Entity/DrawableEntity/MoveableEntity class hierarchy
 • InputManager class
 • Lights.h and shaders which accept lights
 • Skybox class/shader
 • AudioManager class
 • Much, much more
